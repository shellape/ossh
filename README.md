[--]
[03] ssh 172.16.20.14
>id: 2+2
```

Hints
-------

* For choosing the first entry from the overview you can simply hit enter.
* "[--]" in the overview implies that all following entries come from the history file.
* Passing the parameter [-l|--list] just lists the connection overview without asking for a connection id.
* Passing the parameter [-a|--auto] provides the possibility to auto login if there is only
  one unique current connection instead of printing the overview and asking for a connection id.
* If you know what the overview looks like you can pass the id direclty, e.g. "ossh 1" or "ossh 4"
* There are global variables in the script header. Read the script's comments for further information. Default values:
```
HIST_FILE=~/.ossh_history
MAX_HIST_LINES=16
CONN_EXCL_RE='sshfs|sftp|scp| -fnN '
SSH_STRIP_EXPR=''
SSH_BIN=''
```

Known Problems
-------

* increasing ip with v6 is not working
